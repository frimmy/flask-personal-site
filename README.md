flask-personal-site
===================

bare-bones personal page displaying use of Jinja2 templates, template inheritance, and Flask microframework

Set up routes for flask application, and used Foundation (Zurb) for basic layout.

Would like to use for personal website in the near future (for blogs and all things otherwise)!
